                    <h3>How to be Effective</h3>
                    <p>As consumers we never understand the concept of how target marketing manipulates us into
                        purchasing a product. Things that seem to be just natural or by coincidence are actually
                        strategically planned by corporations. Like how the kid branded products of food are all stored
                        on the bottom shelf of grocery stores, or how when you just want to purchase eggs or milk, you
                        have to walk to the back of the supermarket to find it. This isn’t by chance, actually it’s all
                        done for a purpose to get consumers to buy more product. Kids now throw tantrums to get boxes of
                        sugary cereal and you buy pizza rolls even though it wasn’t on your list. We are all victims
                        don’t worry. This same idea is brought over when persuading others with content. The strategy
                        has actually been used for centuries and it’s about using these four rhetorical appeals, logos,
                        ethos, pathos, and kairos, and when used in the most efficient way you have more effective
                        content. I am going to take two forms of content, a comic strip (by Whitney seen above) and an
                        article (“Vegan’s, Freaks, and Animals: Toward a New Table of Friendship” by Taylor), with the
                        same topic of veganism and compare the four rhetorical appeals to see who had the most effective
                        approach.

                    <h3>Logos</h3>

                    Logos, or also known as logic talks about the logistic of the content surprisingly. When
                    comparing these two it’s a little difficult to check facts for a comic strip by just visually
                    looking at it but, there are a few things from this you can take away. For one families go fruit
                    picking as family bonding events, and there is no such thing for waiting in line to gut your own
                    animal as far as my knowledge. You could argue that hunting could be classified as something
                    similar but that’s not accurate. The point of hunting is to go out and hunt it, track it, find
                    it, and shoot it. Not to wait in line just to gut it when its already caught and helpless. This
                    particular article doesn’t have statistics but rather experiences. Sunaura Taylor the author of
                    this article used a quote from Dian Beers’ book For the <i>Prevention of Cruelty: The History and
                    Legacy of Animal Rights Activism in the United States</i> which shows an impactful case and it
                    states “...these misguided souls suffered from ‘zoophilpsychosis.’ As Beers describes,
                    zoophilpsychosis (an overconcern for animals)” (Taylor 759). “These misguided souls” being
                    vegans, have been diagnosed. Which is exactly the shocking information that you want to use when
                    trying to win an audience over. She used small amounts of statistical sources but this quote won
                    the category. <b style="font-size: 18px;">Article 1 Comic 0.</b>

                    <h3>Pathos</h3>

                    Pathos the rhetorical appeal of emotions. This one is more complex when deciding which is better
                    because its primary decider is feeling and calculating feelings is little rough. Let’s start
                    with our current loser the comic. This pulls in two different major feelings by comparing two
                    activities. The first is a happiness or comforting feel with the families getting ready to pick
                    strawberries. Then the second would be a feeling of disgust. Why the feel is disgust is not the
                    empty line by the banner, but the idea of a family lining up to chop up their animal as some
                    comforting family event. It gives a feeling of something like a movie called “The Purge”. It’s
                    not an over the top emotion but it’s effective to get the audience to think of how lining up to
                    slaughter an animal as a family is not okay. The Article goes beyond what it should in thoughts
                    and emotional attachments. Over doing this appeal can be exhausting to the audience, at a point
                    where they start to care less as it goes on. She over extends it to the point where it feels
                    like complaining more then making an argument. For example Tayor states “Pollan feels
                    ‘uncomfortable’ that he now has to be ‘accommodated.’ It is a telling privilege that this is a
                    new experience for him. Disrupting social comfort and requesting accommodation are things
                    disabled people confront all the time” she is now relating being disabled, in her case being in
                    a wheelchair is similar to being vegan. Which is a stretch. Never being able to walk compared to
                    choosing to not eat meat. In her defense she is talking about the accommodations like being
                    wheelchair accessible being compared to having a vegan option on the menu. After this example
                    she starts to bring race into the scenario, which also is a stretch to relate to someone who
                    didn’t chose the way they look. This starts to cause conflict in readers which hurts her content
                    and lost this appeal for her article. <b style="font-size: 18px;">Article 1 Comic 1.</b>
                    <img src="purge-tv-series.jpg" alt=""
                         style="border:3px solid black; position: relative; left: 50%; transform: translateX(-50%); margin-top: 20px; max-width: 500px;">
                    <h3>Ethos</h3>
                    Ethos the appeal of credibility. Personally I believe that the Comic starts with a little more
                    information because it is on a website called peta.com which everyone knows what PETA is. They
                    basically protect animals and have a huge name for themselves. The article was written by an
                    artist Sunaura Taylor, she studied art which doesn’t really help the credibility but in her
                    article she does use tons of information from credible sources. What hurts her credibility is
                    the use of her sources. Like before she takes the extreme and starts to give off a complaint
                    feel more than a feel of a constructive argument. She turns the sources into opinions and starts
                    to force her opinion, other then keeping the facts to support hurt claims. This hurt her
                    credibility and loses this appeal. <b style="font-size: 18px;">Comic 2 Article 1.</b>

                    <h3>Kairos</h3>

                    Kairos the appeal of time and culture is tricky to test. Both put the culture of veganism. The
                    article does stress more of her culture, but then discredits her culture by trying to bring race
                    and disability into the culture which isn’t the focus. I am going to have this one be a
                    stalemate and give each side a point. If the article used its culture in a less forceful way it
                    would’ve easily been the article. <b style="font-size: 18px;">Comic 3 Article 2.</b>

                    <h3>The Winner</h3>
                    Overall the score is Comic 3 and Article 2. This can be expressed either way but overall let me
                    backup my decision. My analysis is based on the average audience. The point would be to reach
                    and effect the largest target audience even the people completely against the topic. The comic
                    is more effective, it doesn’t stretch anything it gives you a different perspective with slight
                    humor which does reach that target. While the article is more targeted towards current vegans.
                    Some of the information can be seen as conflict in the article, a good percent of it actually.
                    Following those four rhetorical appeals will help strengthen both of these, but the comic used
                    it more effectively. <b style="font-size: 18px;"> Winner the Comic with 3 over Article with 2.</b>
